PCB Trays
=========

Simple trays that can be used to hold PCBs vertically during the
production process.

The trays used professionally in factories are usually made from
static-dissipative material that can also withstand immersion in an
ultrasonic bath. These trays aren't intended as a replacement for
those, but just as a handy way for hobbyists to keep small batches
of boards organised or the workbench or shelves. This is much better
than stacking populated PCBs because it saves the parts and boards
being scratched or damaged.

The Fusion360 project includes parameters so that you can tune the
material thickness and the slot size to suit your own requirements.
There is also a parameter for board width, but it's broken at the
moment.

DXFs have also been included, for 3mm MDF and 2mm PCB slots.
