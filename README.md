Laser-Cut PCB Tray
==================

Simple tray design that can be used to safely store PCBs vertically
during the production process.

The trays used by professional PCB assemblers are usually made from
static-dissipative material that can also withstand immersion in an
ultrasonic bath. My design isn't intended as a replacement for those,
but just as a handy way for hobbyists to keep small batches of boards
organised on the workbench or shelves.

This is much better than stacking populated PCBs on top of each other
because it saves the parts and boards being scratched or damaged.

The Fusion360 project includes parameters so that you can tune the
material thickness and the slot size to suit your own requirements.
There is also a parameter for board width, but it's broken at the
moment.

DXFs have also been included, for 3mm MDF and 2mm PCB slots.

For each tray, cut:
* 1 x base
* 2 x sides
* 2 x handles

Glue together as shown in the photo.
